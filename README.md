### Hi, I'm Murat Taha! 👋

I am a **Senior Mechanical Engineering Student** at **Marmara University** , driven by a passion for the **Defense Industry** and **Autonomous Systems**.

Unlike a traditional mechanical engineer, I focus on bridging the gap between **physical systems** and **computational intelligence**. My goal is to develop autonomous systems where mechanics meet advanced control algorithms and data science.
